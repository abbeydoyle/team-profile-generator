# team-profile-generator
Node.js command-line application that generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each team member

## Description

This project uses npm, inquirer, fs, jest, and javascript to generate a Team Portfolio Page with user input. All input is given within the terminal using Inquirer, a command line interface for Node.js. There are employee-specific prompts, allowing for more personilized employee cards. This webpage file is then written into the project repository with the Node File System module. Each class and subclass was tested using Jest script tests, ensuring the correct object types and function returns. This project introduced working in the command line with Node Package Manager (npm), using javascript to create functions, inquirer prompts, and a string that will populate the webpage.

## Usage

There are 10 main sections of this repository:

- [SRC Folder](https://github.com/abbeydoyle/team-profile-generator/tree/main/src) - Contains a text file for ideas, a [generateHTML.js](https://github.com/abbeydoyle/team-profile-generator/blob/main/src/generateHTML.js) file, encoding the functions to create the Team Portfolio webpage based on the user input gathered from inquirer

- [index.js](https://github.com/abbeydoyle/team-profile-generator/blob/main/index.html) - Contains the main script of this application, encluding the file writing system and inquirer prompts

- [Dist Folder](https://github.com/abbeydoyle/team-profile-generator/tree/main/dist) - Created by the script to contain the index.html file generated through this app

- [Lib Folder](https://github.com/abbeydoyle/team-profile-generator/tree/main/lib) - Contains the scripts containing class and subclass creation

- [Notes Folder](https://github.com/abbeydoyle/team-profile-generator/tree/main/notes) - Contains a text file for ideas, a [structure.html](https://github.com/abbeydoyle/team-profile-generator/blob/main/notes/structure.html) html page to envision the final product of this application, and graveyard javascript files to place nonworking code for future reference

- [Test Folder](https://github.com/abbeydoyle/team-profile-generator/tree/main/test) - Contains Jest testing scripts for each class and subclass functions

- [gitignore](https://github.com/abbeydoyle/team-profile-generator/blob/main/.gitignore) - Contains all files to be ignored in the Github repository
