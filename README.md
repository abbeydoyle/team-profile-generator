# team-profile-generator
Node.js command-line application that generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each team member

## Description

This project uses npm, inquirer, fs, jest, and javascript to generate a Team Portfolio Page with user input. All input is given within the terminal using Inquirer, a command line interface for Node.js. There are employee-specific prompts, allowing for more personilized employee cards. This webpage file is then written into the project repository with the Node File System module. Each class and subclass was tested using Jest script tests, ensuring the correct object types and function returns. This project introduced working in the command line with Node Package Manager (npm), using javascript to create functions, inquirer prompts, and a string that will populate the webpage.
